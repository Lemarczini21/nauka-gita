    <h1>Painkiller</h1>
    <h2>Utw√≥r: Judas Priest</h2>
    <h3>Tekst</h3>
    <p>Faster than a bullet<br>
        Terrifying scream<br>
        Enraged and full of anger<br>
        He is half man and half machine<br>
        Rides the metal monster<br>
        Breathing smoke and fire<br>
        Closing in with vengeance soaring high<br>
        He is the painkiller<br>
        This is the painkiller<br>
        Planets devastated<br>
        Mankind's on its knees<br>
        A savior comes from out the skies<br>
        In answer to their pleas<br>
        Through boiling clouds if thunder<br>
        Blasting bolts of steel<br>
        Evils going under deadly wheels<br>
        He is the painkiller<br>
        This is the painkiller<br>
        Faster then a laser bullet<br>
        Louder than an atom bomb<br>
        Chromium plated boiling metal<br>
        Brighter than a thousand suns<br>
        Flying high on rapture<br>
        Stronger free and brave<br>
        Nevermore encaptured<br>
        They've been brought back from the grave<br>
        With mankind resurrected<br>
        Forever to survive<br>
        Returns from Armageddon to the skies<br>
        He is the painkiller<br>
        This is the painkiller<br>
        Wings of steel painkiller<br>
        Deadly wheels painkiller<br>
        He is the painkiller<br>
        This is the painkiller<br>
        He is the painkiller<br>
        This is the painkiller<br>
        Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!<br>
        Pain! Pain! Killer! Killer!<br>
        Can't stop the painkiller<br>
        Pain (pain)<br>
    </p>
